# Arduino-projects.
First Simple project

Project Title: Photo Regulator

Overview:
The Photo Regulator project is designed to regulate light exposure in a seed bed using a servo motor, photoresistor, and LEDs. The system dynamically adjusts blinds to optimize the light intensity for seed germination.
The project is a prototype, used one servo motor, two leds(red and green), potentiometer, two resistors , photoresistor and an arduino uno. The actual system will require more servo motors that will be mechanically coupled to the blinds, more resistors , photoresistors and micro controllers. A monitor can be added to monitor the light intesisty and the system can be improved to interact with the user, analyse and manipulate the data it extracts to reveal insights that may aid in forecasting and the overall management of the seed bed.
The system can be integrated to extract other inferences like humidity and temperature, air condition and soil moisture, all of which are immperative to the growth and maturity of seedlings

Problem Statement:
In agriculture, controlling light exposure is crucial for seed development. The Photo Regulator addresses the need for an automated solution, ensuring optimal growing conditions.

Solution:
The project employs a servo motor to control blinds based on real-time light readings from a photoresistor and a resistor. LED indicators provide visual feedback. This automated regulation enhances seed germination and overall plant growth.

Skills Acquired:

Embedded Systems: Implemented servo motor control for precise blind adjustment.
Sensor Integration: Integrated photoresistor to capture ambient light levels.
Programming: Developed code for motor control.
Problem Solving: Addressed challenges in creating an efficient and responsive system.
Significance:
The Photo Regulator not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also showcases the ability to apply engineering principles to real-world challenges. This project contributes to sustainable agriculture practices by optimizing resource utilization.

This endeavor has honed my skills in practical problem-solving, coding, and system integrationâ€”an invaluable addition to my evolving skill set.
